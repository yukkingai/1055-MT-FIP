# About Dr. Nut Graphic Design part from Lam Chau Lin
This project is to redesign a soft drink brand, Dr. Nut, which is a drink suitable for adults and children, so our main new design of Dr. Nut is a "simple lifestyle" suitable for both children and adults.

# About the Dr. Nut logo design
We want the redesigned logo to keep "squirrel" and "nuts" which are Dr. Nut using a long time, so I combine these and use the squirrel's tail to make Dr. Nut's "D" letter, which makes the logo look friendly and lively, and brings freshness to the guests. In addition, there also keeps the orange-brown color that retains the classic color of Dr. Nut. This color can easily remind people of squirrels and nuts, which naturally reminds our products. Also, orange-brown is a very suitable color for adults and children.

# About the bottle and label design
The bottle design is designed by my partner Yuki, and I do some modifications. I am responsible for the design of the label on the bottle. Because all Dr. Nut products have material of nuts, so I make the label into the shape of a hut to highlight its main flavor. In fact, our goal is to bring guests a cool feeling by Dr. Nut, which design is also in line with the purpose of soft drinks, so we choose materials of glass for making the bottle. Because there are 3 different flavors (Original, Lemon, and Strawberry), the transparent design also makes it easy for guests to see what the flavor is inside. It also retains its classic "soft drink bottle" shape of Dr. Nut.

# About promotion image 01 design
The design theme of this picture is summer vacation, and the background is a summer beach with the sun shining down. I want to highlight the refreshing feeling of the product and make people think of Dr. Nut for the first moment in summer when they feel hot and thirsty. "Time to drink Dr. Nut, and there are 3 flavors for them to choose from!"

# About promotion image 02-04 design
These 3 pictures are the same series of designs to express independent products of 3 flavors (Original, Lemon, Strawberry). I mainly want to bring out the design of daily lifestyle to the guests because the beverages are suitable for all seasons and occasions. Furthermore, the products and the main drink materials are placed together in the image, so it can let the guests know what kind of drink it tastes like at a glance, and some illustrations on it also make the whole picture lively.
