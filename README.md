# Multimedia Authoring 2 - FIP Midterm

This is our Final Integrated Project - Rebrand & Marketing Campaign for MMED-1055 Multimedia Authoring 2 class in Fanshawe College.

From the beginning of the project, we heard of this rebrand campaign that we need to choose one of the brands for our project. They are all no longer exist, therefore, this rebrand and marketing campaign will be something interesting to shock the consumer market.

We chose Dr. Nut :squirrel:because of it targets public market for all age groups as a soft drink company and with its squirrel icon, we could capture more young generation and children to know about this old brand from their ancestors in a brand refreshed campaign.:chestnut:

:fire:Research of this brand are including all its old packaging, logo design, and product design. Additionally, we take reference of a bottle design from other brands, such as Coca-Cola and BLUE GIRL premium beer. The website of BLUE GIRL (https://www.bluegirlbeer.com/hk/) inspires us a lot:bulb:, from its graphic design to animation, its brand marketing is mature to showcase customers about its brand history and its logos development in these 110 years.

At this moment, we got an idea of our website wireframe, some research images for reference, poster design and marketing usage. Also, we have our bottle design done, logo and package label, etc. Looking forward to discover what css and javascript we could add on the website. :+1:
